### 1.1. Folder structure
All instances can be found in folder **/instances**. Each instance has its own (sub)folder with an identifiable name. In it are found five files:
- **classes_classroom.json** — Contains data pertaining to classes which require only classrooms.
- **classes_pc.json** — Contains data pertaining to classes which require computer labs.
- **locations_classroom.json** — Contains data pertaining to locations classified as classrooms or hybrid locations.
- **locations_pc.json** — Contains data pertaining to locations classified as computer labs or hybrid locations.
- **occupied_locations.json** — List of timeslot-location pairs, each of which denote a location unavailable for assignments during that timeslot. This are used to represent cases where the lectures of some specific subjects must be assigned to specific locations, and as such are not considered in our instances.

The structure of these files is detailed in the following sections.
